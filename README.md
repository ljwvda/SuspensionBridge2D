# SuspensionBridge2D

In this repository you can find the MATLAB code corresponding to the paper 'Periodic localized traveling waves in the two-dimensional suspension bridge equation' by Lindsey van der Aalst, Jan Bouwe van den Berg and Jean-Philippe Lessard.

To run the proofs corresponding to the Results section in the paper, you have to run the MATLAB files main_ExampleSol.m, main_Figb.m, main_Figc.m, main_Figd.m, main_Fige.m and main_Figf.m. The file readme.m provides explanation of the different files.

Note that in order to obtain rigorous proofs, INTLAB (see https://www.tuhh.de/ti3/rump/) is required.

To reproduce the plot in Section 6, you have to run main_cont.m inside the Continuation_PowerSeries folder. This folder contains a separate readme-file.
